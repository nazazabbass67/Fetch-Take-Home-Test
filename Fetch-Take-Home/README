Site Reliability Engineering Health Check
Overview
This tool checks the health of multiple HTTP endpoints and logs their availability over time. It sends requests every 15 seconds, marks each endpoint as "UP" or "DOWN" based on its response, and calculates the cumulative availability percentage for each domain.

Files
health_check.py: The main script that performs health checks and logs availability.
config.yaml: Configuration file listing the HTTP endpoints to monitor.

Setup
Prerequisites
Python 3.x

Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip3 install pyyaml requests
Configuration File (config.yaml)

Define the endpoints you want to monitor in config.yaml. Hereâ€™s an example:

    user-agent: fetch-synthetic-monitor
  method: GET
  name: fetch index page
  url: https://fetch.com/

- name: fetch rewards index page

Each entry can include:

name: Description of the endpoint.
url: The URL to check.

headers and body (optional).
